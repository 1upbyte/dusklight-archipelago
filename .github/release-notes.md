## Install

1. **Mod** — put `archipelago.dusk` in your Dusklight mods folder:
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\TwilitRealm\Dusklight\mods`
   - Linux: `~/.local/share/TwilitRealm/Dusklight/mods`
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/TwilitRealm/Dusklight/mods`
2. **Apworld** — put `tp_dusklight.apworld` in your Archipelago `custom_worlds` folder.
3. **YAML** — grab a preset below, or generate a template from the Archipelago Launcher. Set `name:` to your slot name.

Then in Dusklight: use the arrows on the Play button to pick **Archipelago**, start a **new file**, and enter your server address, slot name and password. The seed builds from the server and you play.

Needs Dusklight 2.0.1 or newer. This mod carries its own copy of the randomizer, so Dusklight's built-in Randomizer doesn't need updating or removing; the two don't interfere.

## What's new in 1.7.1

- **No gameplay changes.** The mod's code is reorganised for contributors: the game mode is split into one file per area, the architecture and contributing guides and the test tools are now in the repo, and CI runs the host tests on every platform.
- The apworld is unchanged (1.9.0), and 1.7.0 multiworlds keep working: just swap in the new `archipelago.dusk`.

New in 1.7.0: Collect Dungeon on Completion (YAML option) and randomizer 1.0.6.

## Updating

Update the mod and the apworld **together**. The generating host needs the new apworld for the new presets and options; if the logic data ever differs between a player's mod and the seed, the mod refuses it and says to update. Finish any multiworld already in progress on the versions you started it with.
